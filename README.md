# Counselor App

Hey! Great to see you here, come check out this small app I created! This app simulates a basic communcation application for a small camp counselor team.

## System Requirements: 
- The one major requirement is that you have the latest XCode version downloaded. 
- XCode can only be downloaded on a macOS device 

## Steps:

1. clone repo
``` 
git clone https://github.com/upneetsb/Counselor-App.git
```
2. navigate to the project and open the final_project.xcworkspace file.
```
cd Counselor-App
open final_project.xcworkspace -a "xcode"
```

3. to run this application click the triangle run button in the XCode Application or âŒ˜R (Command + R) 

4. enjoy, feel free to mess around with the different features. just remember any changes you make, every other user will see!
 ps. checkout Counselor_App_Demo.zip for a full demo on the project
